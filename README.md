Author: Nguyen Luu Bao Duy

Tool Used: Power BI

# **üìë** Table of Contents

# **üìå** Project Overview

## üéØ Project Objectives

This project leverages the AdventureWorks dataset to develop a Power BI dashboard that enables the Executive Board to better understand customer dynamics and derive actionable segmentation. The dashboard is designed to provide clarity on who the customers are, how they behave, and how the company can strategically respond to these insights.

Our objectives are to:

- Build a comprehensive profile of the company‚Äôs customer demographics.
- Analyze purchasing patterns and behavioral trends.
- Segment customers using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) framework.
- Recommend strategies to retain valuable customers, attract new ones, and nurture long-term growth across segments.

## üë• Target audience

- Sales & Marketing Team
- Product Team
- Customer Service Team
- Analytics and Data Team

## **üõ∞Ô∏è Scope of Analysis**

- Focus exclusively on **individual (B2C) customers**.
- Rationale: B2C customers demonstrate distinct characteristics, purchasing behavior, spending power, and motivations compared to B2B customers.

## **üß© Assumptions**

- **Reference date for analysis**: the last recorded date in the dataset.
    - *Rationale*: Since the data was dropped in June 2014, selecting the latest available date ensures meaningful insights, particularly for time-sensitive metrics such as *Age* and *Recency*.
- **Fiscal year**: January to December.
- **Currency**: All monetary values are standardized in **USD** (as the Currency table only provides conversion from USD to other currencies).

# **üß† Design Thinking Process**

This analysis uses a process called ‚Äú**Design Thinking**‚Äù to generate ideas and solve problems.

## **What is Design Thinking?**

Design Thinking is a **human-centered, iterative approach to problem-solving** that emphasizes understanding users, redefining problems, and creating innovative solutions through rapid prototyping and testing.

It is built on 5 stages:

1. **Empathize** ‚Äì deeply understand the needs, pain points, and goals of users.
2. **Define** ‚Äì clearly articulate the problem statement.
3. **Ideate** ‚Äì generate a wide range of creative solutions.
4. **Prototype** ‚Äì build quick, tangible versions of the solution.
5. **Test** ‚Äì validate with users, gather feedback, and refine.

Unlike linear methods, Design Thinking is flexible and iterative, allowing teams to circle back when new insights emerge. It balances **desirability (user needs)**, **feasibility (technical capabilities)**, and **viability (business goals)**.

## **Why Design Thinking for BI projects?**

Business Intelligence (BI) initiatives often struggle when they focus too much on **tools, data models, and dashboards** while overlooking **actual user needs**. Design Thinking ensures BI solutions are not just technically correct but **practically impactful**.

Key reasons:

- **User-centric dashboards & reports**: BI outputs directly address decision-makers‚Äô real challenges rather than overwhelming them with unused metrics.
- **Alignment with business goals**: Encourages defining the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind every visualization or KPI, preventing data for data‚Äôs sake.
- **Collaboration across roles**: Breaks silos between business users, analysts, and IT by co-creating solutions.
- **Faster iteration**: Prototyping dashboards early helps validate insights before heavy data engineering investment.
- **Higher adoption**: When end-users are involved from the start, BI solutions are more intuitive, actionable, and widely adopted.

üëâ In short, Design Thinking makes BI projects move from **‚Äújust reporting‚Äù** to **‚Äústrategic decision support‚Äù** by combining data with empathy, creativity, and business context.

# **üìä Key Insights & Visualizations**

## **üîç Dashboard Preview**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Demographics Overview**

üéØ **Objective**: The purpose of this section is to provide a comprehensive overview of the demographic profile of AdventureWorks‚Äô individual (B2C) customers, highlighting key patterns that can inform marketing, product, and customer engagement strategies.

**üìå Key Findings**

AdventureWorks serves approximately 18,500 individual consumers, with the customer base largely composed of **middle-aged** individuals who demonstrate strong **long-term loyalty**. The majority of customers are concentrated in **North America**, particularly in the Southwest and Northwest regions. Income distribution is centered within the **$25,000‚Äì$75,000** range, suggesting a stable but not overly affluent customer segment. Overall, the profile indicates a **loyal**, **stable** group of consumers who are **less mobile** and highly suitable for l**ifecycle marketing strategies**, **upselling initiatives**, and **geographically targeted activations**.

**‚öß Gender and Marital Status**

- **The gender split is nearly balanced**, with 51% male and 49% female, suggesting that marketing messages do not need to be strongly gender-specific.
- A majority of 54% of customers are married, which opens **opportunities for couple-oriented or family-oriented campaigns**.

**üéì Education**

- The majority of customers hold either a **Bachelor‚Äôs degree** or **Partial College** education, indicating a broad mid-level educational base.
- A notable proportion possess **Graduate-level degrees**, highlighting a valuable segment for **premium products** with technical or value-driven positioning.
- Marketing strategies should **balance** between **emphasizing practical product value** for those with lower formal education and **showcasing sophistication or premium attributes** for the more highly educated.

**üìÜ First Order Year and Tenure**

- Customer acquisition peaked in 2003, when about 7,700 individuals‚Äîrepresenting 42% of the base‚Äîmade their first purchase.
- The customer base demonstrates **loyalty**, with an average tenure of 21 years, reflecting **long-term engagement** and **strong brand history**.

**üë• Age Group**

- The customer base is heavily concentrated in the **middle-aged** segment, with 60% between **35 and 54 years old**. The largest subgroup is ages 45‚Äì54 (33%), followed by ages 35‚Äì44 (27%), both of which typically exhibit **stable income** and **consistent purchasing power**.
- **Younger consumers are underrepresented**, with ages 25‚Äì34 making up only 2% of the base, emphasizing the need for strategies to capture younger demographics.

**üíº Occupation**

- **Professionals** and **Skilled Manual** workers are the two most common occupational groups, together reflecting **stable income levels** and **solid purchasing capacity** to spend on mid-tier to high-tier products.
- Marketing approaches may need differentiation: **Professionals** are likely to respond to messages emphasizing **design**, **innovation**, while **Skilled Manual** workers may value **durability** and **performance,** and **practical utility** more highly.

**üöó Commute and Distance to Store**

- Approximately 34% of customers live within one mile of a store. This indicates that one-third of the company‚Äôs customers are **local customers** who do not take too much effort to find a store.
- This proximity offers strong potential for **in-store promotions**, c**ommunity-based events**, and **geo-targeted advertising**.

**üíµ Income**

- The majority of customers fall within the **$25,000‚Äì$75,000** income bracket, representing about 61% of the base. This group forms the **primary target** for **pricing strategies** and **promotional offers** tailored to **mid-level affordability**.
- A smaller, high-income segment (earning above **$100,000**, around 9% of the base) presents a clear opportunity for **upselling premium products** and **offering exclusive services**.

**üåç Geography**

- **North America is the dominant market**, accounting for 51% of customers, with the Southwest (24%) and Northwest (18%) as key subregions.
- **The Pacific region**, primarily **Australia**, contributes nearly 20% of the customer base, highlighting its importance as a **secondary market**.
- **European markets -** including the **United Kingdom**, **France**, and **Germany -** also make up a meaningful share, providing opportunities for region-specific strategies.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Performance Analysis**

üéØ **Objective**: The goal of this analysis is to evaluate customer purchasing performance, including order value, purchase drivers, and revenue contribution.

**üìå Key Findings**

- On average, each customer generates approximately **$1,760 in revenue** and **$632 in gross profit**. With 18,500 customers placing 28,000 orders, this equates to **1 - 2 orders per customer**, with an average order value of **$1,170**. This indicates that the purchasing behaviour appears relatively limited, with few repeat transactions. However, this pattern is reasonable given the nature of bicycles - a product with a long usage lifecycle and low replacement frequency within a short period.
- Revenue and profit growth both recorded **positive year-over-year growth from 2012 to 2013**. However, both metrics declined from 2013 to 2014. This decline is partly explained by a **data limitation**: the dataset only covers up to **June 2014.** The fact that we don‚Äôt have sufficient data for the last two quarters of 2014 indicates that making comparisons of the first two quarters of 2014 with the full-year 2013 is misleading. When viewed on a **month-by-month basis**, revenue and profit continued to show **steady growth through May 2014**.
- A similar trend is observed in **order volume growth**. In 2013 and 2014, order counts were nearly **triple the combined totals of 2011 and 2012**. While 2014 appears to show a decline, this is again due to incomplete data. Monthly analysis confirms that order volumes were growing consistently, with strong momentum particularly from **June 2013 through May 2014**.
- Analysis of **purchase motivations** reveals that **82% of customers are primarily price-driven**. Other factors, such as promotions, product quality, and brand reputation play a much smaller role. Interestingly, in 2011 and 2012, most customers purchased based on quality and brand reputation, whereas in 2013 and 2014, **price became the dominant driver**. This shift highlights **increasing price sensitivity**, suggesting the need for a well-calibrated pricing strategy or strong value-added justifications for price increases.
- **Discounts accounted for only 6‚Äì8% of sales annually**, indicating that the company does not heavily rely on promotions. This reflects a positive signal of **brand strength and pricing power**.
- Customer contribution analysis shows **no clear linear correlation between the number of orders and the revenue generated**. Instead, three distinct clusters emerge:
    1. Customers with few orders and low revenue (general customers).
    2. Customers with many orders but low revenue (primarily accessory buyers).
    3. Customers with few orders but high revenue (premium customers purchasing high-value bicycles or multiple items in a single order).
    
     üëâ This reflects the dual nature of AdventureWorks‚Äô business model - **bicycles versus bicycle accessories -** and indicates that value creation lies more in **maximizing order value** rather than driving frequent repeat purchases.
    

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ RFM Analysis**

üéØ **Objective**: The goal of this analysis is to segment customers using the RFM model into 11 groups.

**üèóÔ∏è What is an RFM Framework?**

RFM (Recency ‚Äì Frequency ‚Äì Monetary) is a customer segmentation model based on transaction history. It helps assess both the value of customers and their level of engagement with the business. Each customer is scored across three dimensions:

- **Recency (R):** The time elapsed since the customer‚Äôs most recent purchase. The shorter the gap, the higher the likelihood of repeat purchases. A longer gap, in contrast, indicates a higher risk of churn.
- **Frequency (F):** The number of transactions made within a defined period. Customers who purchase more frequently tend to have a stronger relationship with the brand and respond more actively to marketing efforts.
- **Monetary (M):** The total amount of money a customer has spent. This reflects their spending capacity and their overall contribution to company revenue.

**üå± Benefits of RFM Analysis**

Applying the RFM framework provides several advantages:

- Increases the effectiveness of personalized marketing campaigns.
- Improves Customer Lifetime Value.
- Supports segmentation for targeted product launches.
- Strengthens customer loyalty and engagement.
- Reduces churn by identifying at-risk customers.
- Optimizes marketing spend and improves ROI.
- Enhances the performance of remarketing and retargeting campaigns.

**üõ†Ô∏è Scoring Methodology**

Each customer is evaluated using the three RFM dimensions:

- **Recency:** Calculated as the difference between the analysis date and the customer‚Äôs last transaction date.
- **Frequency:** Measured by counting the total number of invoices or transactions per customer.
- **Monetary:** Measured by summing the total value of all purchases across the customer‚Äôs lifetime.

Once calculated, the values for each dimension are divided into five equal groups (quintiles), with scores assigned from 1 to 5. A score of 1 represents the lowest value, while a score of 5 represents the highest.

The scoring direction differs by dimension:

- **Recency:** Lower values (more recent activity) receive higher scores.
- **Frequency and Monetary:** Higher values receive higher scores.

By combining these three scores, each customer is assigned an **RFM score**, resulting in up to **125 unique combinations**. These combinations are then mapped into well-defined customer segments according to a segmentation framework.

| Segment                   | RFM Scores                                                                                                             | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
